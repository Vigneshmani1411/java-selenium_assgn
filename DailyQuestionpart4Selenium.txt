1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.

	:-Selenium is an open-source automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. 
	:-Selenium has four major components â€“ 
		Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment), 	
		Selenium RC(Remote Control), 
		Selenium Web driver, 
		Selenium GRID.
	:-Selenium WebDriver is a browser automation framework that accepts commands and sends them to a browser, which are used to automate the testing of a web application.


2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?

	:-Selenium interacts with browsers using Selenium RC Server. It injects JavaScript function into browsers when the web page is loaded. 


3) What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?

	:-Selenium supports 8 different types of locators namely id, name, className, tagName, linkText, partialLinkText, CSS selector and xpath.


4) Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
	
	:-ID is considered as unique key so there cannot be more than 1 elements for same ID while Xpath is created using relative path/position of elements, so there can be cases when we can get 2 or more elements for same Xpath.


5) How to select value in dropdown?

	:-Select WebElement classname = driver.findelement(By locator)
		selectByValue - It is used to select an option based on its 'value' attribute. 


6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?

	:- Absolute Xpath: It uses Complete path from the Root Element to the desire element. 
	:- Relative Xpath: It starts by referencing the element as they are not the complete paths from the root element.


7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html

	:- objectname.findelement(By.anylocators).isSelected();
		The return type is boolen and its gives output as true when checkbox is enabled, and false when checkbox is not enabled.


8) Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager

	:- The setProperty method is used because the browser doesn't have a built-in server to run the automation code.
	:- WebDriverManager automates the browser setup in the Selenium code.


9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
	
	:- Preceding xpath
		Younger cousin xpath // preceding :: tagname of elder cousin
		ex : //input[@id='password']//preceding::label
		ex : //label[text()='username']//following::input

	:- Following xpath 
		Elder cousin xpath // following :: tagname of younger cousin
		ex : //label[text()='username']//following::input


10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?

	:- element. getAttribute(attributeName) 
		By using the syntax we can get the attribute name.
